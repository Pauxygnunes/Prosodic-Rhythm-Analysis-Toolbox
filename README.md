# Prosodic-Rhythm-Analysis-Toolbox
The Prosodic Rhythm Analysis Toolbox is a set of data, scripts, and functions, devised to operate and visualize the relations between prosodic rhythm profiles, following the theories of Leonard Meyer and Fred Lerdahl. It is linked to a research in progress developed at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
